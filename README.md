# C-Sharp (C#) class(es) to various JavaScript classes functions

This project in it's true form should contain .Net class library which will handle conversion of C# classes to JavaScript classes:
* Vanilla
* ECMA 6
* ECMA 6 with knockout
(for now.)

I will be actively working on creating user interface for better user experience.


## Disclamer: 

For start I cloned [this repo](https://github.com/castle-it/sharp2Js), and it's core functionalities are mostly still here.<br>
A lot of stuff was modified heavily to suit my needs, and will be probably changed in future.
